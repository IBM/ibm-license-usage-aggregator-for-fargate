# Contributing guidelines

## Contributing A Patch

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
1. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.
1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
1. Commit your changes with DCO
1. Submit a pull request.

## Issue and Pull Request Management

Anyone may comment on issues and submit reviews for pull requests. However, in
order to be assigned an issue or pull request, you must be a member of the
[IBM](https://github.com/ibm) GitHub organization.

Repo maintainers can assign you an issue or pull request by leaving a
`/assign <your Github ID>` comment on the issue or pull request.


### Merge approval

The project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code
review to indicate acceptance. A change requires LGTMs from two of the
maintainers of each component affected.

For a list of the maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

## Legal

Each source file must include a license header for the Apache
Software License 2.0. Using the SPDX format is the simplest approach.
e.g.

```
/*
Copyright <holder> All Rights Reserved.

SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
*/
```

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This
applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the
same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) - that the Linux® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin)
uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer
must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the
submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using the following command:

```
git commit -s
```

## Linting

- PEP8

## Verify

Make sure that `pytest` is passing.
